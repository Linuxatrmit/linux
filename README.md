# Project Description
## Overview
### Topic
An open-source training course and education resources, accessible for distance learning via online login. This will focus on the Operating System and its utilities.
### Motivation
The main focus will be on the Linux operating system, remote login via ***ssh*** to the project's *Amazon Instance Image* (AMI) on **Amazon EC2**, where live and on-demand interaction with the target operating system and its utilities will be tested and visualized.
There is a considerable increase in software migration to the Linux Operating System, and while not long ago, you had to own a ***physical*** copy of the operating system in order to run it, this is not true with the advance of the cloud era, where remote login to a Linux distribution instance - launched on the cloud servers, allows one to get the full Linux experience without the cost and investment associated with its installation and maintenance.
And while remote login may be slow at times, with the advance of *Windowes Subsystem for Linux* (**WSL**) by Microsoft, one can ***natively*** run and experience the full Linux ecosystem with all its useful utilities, out of the Windows OS, without the spending time to manually partition and dual booting to another Operating-System on the same machine.
### Landscape
There is no shortage of Linux documentation online, from books to online-documentation, dedicated YouTube channels, certification institutes and university courses, as well as the open-source nature of its ecosystem that invites everybody to download the source-code, modify, fix and test the results.
Though it may seem like a saturated market, consider the huge demand, and endless topics with enormous complexities and ever changing landscape where the dynamic nature of the open-source community keeps changing trends and calls for endless training and update resources.
## Detailed Description
### Aims
To provide an interactive and rich environment to be readily accessible online, for Linux Documentation.
By interactive, meaning the utilities may be visualized, with custom installed, users are given remote login access, and on-demand processes are interacting the client interfacing the system.
### Plans and Progress
There are 3 main parts to the project, each strongly associated with each other, as they finally integrate to provide a full blown and rich project to bring the full experience to the client.
they include:
1. The documentation component, where major focus will be on installing, booting and testing the Operating system and its utilities.
2. The remote server, which will provide an online dynamic interactive on-demand sessions, to demonstrated and visualize complicated topics.
3. The practice section, where an online repository of practice questions and tasks will be utilized by a perspective client in preparation for a technical job interview, or for personal interest and practice in the field.
### Roles
### Scope and Limits
### Tools and Technologies
   * **Git**. As the main *Version Control System* (VCS), as a client to manage and/or track the project, interact with online repositories to upload/download source code, ans as tool for bug fixes.
  * **Shell** (*Ash*, *Bash*, *Zsh*): The 3 main shells will be tested and compared for their individual advantages and disadvantages, their level of compliance with the Posix standsard and other Linux standards, the "plugins" available to automate their use, providing interactive prompts, online completion and look into advance batch scripting, cron jobs, and useful utilities to provide automatic and periodic constant system backups and restoration points, to keep the system fully reliable and updated, with its data fully secured.
### Testing
  * Technical issues are expected for any remote deployment, and the accuracy of the documentation should always be carefully checked and verified, by automating a test suite to be automatically run before any project upgrade. These tests should cover all aspects of the project, from the technical issues, user's interface experience and the server infrastructure viability.

  Week 6 to week 16 | Will take a full-time work load of all 4 developers to complete this project: 10 hours per week, for a total of 10 weeks, to further develop the front-end of the website.  10 hours per week, for a total of 10 weeks, to test and develop the documentation of the project.  10 hours per week, for a total of 10 weeks, to setup the client's interface to remote server of the project's instance on Amazon EC2.  10 hours per week, for a total of 10 weeks, to adjust the aesthetic and professional look for the project.
### Risks
   Allowing your server to be granted remote access via *ssh* present major security risks.
   Only authorized users should be given access. Only via *ssh keys*, where password alone will not suffice. Their interaction with the server should be monitored and limited to provide a reasonable balance between security and accessibility.

### Group Processes and Communication
   Constant communication and cooperation should exist between the front-end developers providing the client interface to the project and the backend developers who program the underlying processes empowering this interaction.
# Skills and Jobs
1. ***Front-end developer.***
 * To develop an interactive and responsive client interface to the website, to be readily accessible, and dynamically configured to meed the client's interests.
2. ***System administrator.***
 * To develop and test the documentation and the visual effects for the utilities demonstrated.
3. ***Cloud specialist.***
 * To maintain the cloud instance, where on-demand processes will be launched to interact with a remote login client, to visualize the targeted system utilities.
4. ***Graphic designer.***
 * To maintain the aesthetic and professional image of the project.
# Group Reflection
 The website needs new sections on networking and storage. The client for the cloud instance should be published, where users are given authorized access to the remote server after initial authentication have been established. The github page reflects the very nature of development so far.
